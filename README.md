# Magic-Shop
The Magic Shop is a full stack web application designed to simulate your standard web store with a fantasy inspired twist. There are three roles; adventurers, workers, and the shop owner. Adventurers can buy, sell, and even attempt to steal goods at the Magic Shop. Workers are responsible for catching thieves in the act and restocking inventory. The shop owner is responsible for hiring/firing workers and managing what items can be ordered.
