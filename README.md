# Magic-Shop
The Medieval Magic shop is a full stack web app designed to function as a regular website store with a twist. The web app will keep track of shop inventory, customerâ€™s personal inventory, and purchases. Employees can manage items, accept offers, and restock. The Shop owner has the ability to change the status of employees and customers and add new items to the order catalog. Customers will be able to browse the store without being logged in but must login to add items to a cart and/or make purchases or make an attempt to steal from the shop. If they fail to steal, they are banned from the store and all of their assets are confiscated and added to the store. Customers can also sell to the shop.
